# Employee Skills Gap Analyzer

## Overview
The Employee Skills Gap Analyzer is a comprehensive application designed to identify skill gaps within a company and predict employee development needs. This system helps organizations understand where their employees need skill improvement and provides data-driven insights for training and development programs.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Employee Skill Assessment**: Analyze current skill levels of employees across different competencies
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify skill gaps at individual, team, and organizational levels
- **Predictive Modeling**: ML-based predictions for skill development recommendations
- **Company Information Management**: Store and manage comprehensive company and employee data
- **Skills Tracking**: Monitor skill progression over time
- **Training Recommendations**: Suggest targeted training programs based on identified gaps

### Technical Features
- RESTful API for data management and analysis
- Machine Learning models for skill gap prediction
- Interactive dashboard for visualization
- Data export and reporting capabilities
- Scalable architecture for enterprise use

- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd employee-skills-gap-analyzer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_database.py
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Data Input
1. Upload employee data including:
   - Personal information
   - Current skills and competency levels
   - Job roles and responsibilities
   - Training history

2. Define company skill requirements:
   - Role-specific skill requirements
   - Proficiency levels needed
   - Future skill demands

### Analysis
1. Run skill gap analysis to identify:
   - Individual skill gaps
   - Team-level skill deficiencies
   - Organization-wide skill needs

2. Generate predictions for:
   - Employee skill development potential
   - Training effectiveness estimates
   - Timeline for skill acquisition

### Reporting
- Generate comprehensive reports on skill gaps
- Export data for further analysis
- Create visualizations for stakeholder presentations
